Inspired by sc-fi movies set in the not too distant future, Betatron originally started life as a type experiment on our Instagram. After receiving an overwhelmingly positive response it quickly developed into a fully functional typeface which is now available to download for free. Betatron features solely vertical, horizontal, and 45° diagonal lines as it tries to capture each letterform in an abstract and dynamic way. 

Betatron will look familiar to our followers, since our retail type family Coanda is based on a similar type of grid and is a hat tip to Wim Crouwel’s parametric New Alphabet. Betatron is, however, sharper and more audacious than Coanda, if we may say so ourselves. 

This type family features a Latin Extended character set, covering most languages written with the Latin script.
